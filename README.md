1) Put this inside composer.json:

        "repositories": [
                {
                    "type": "vcs",
                    "url": "https://github.com/harithkhairol/laravel-generate-migration-with-model-from-excel"
                }
            ]

If repositories doesn't exist, just add it at the root level (same level as require).
   
2) run composer require harithkhairol/laravel-generate-migration-with-model-from-excel:dev-main
